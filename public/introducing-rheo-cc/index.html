<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to Rheo.cc! I built this site as something of a staging ground for various concepts I am researching/presenting/talking about/considering. In that respect it&rsquo;s something of a scratch-pad where I can (semi-)anonymously throw (mis-?)information at the Universe and see what happens. I envision it eventually taking the shape of an old-school personal blog, รก la Blogger pre-2005, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>My name is Jason and I currently work as a Data Scientist and occasional Software Engineer. In school I studied Math, Physics, and Economics, but eventually became frustrated that I was rarely creating anything of my own. I have always been taken with Paul Gaugin&rsquo;s facsimile in <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>, particularly his deeply-felt need to create the world around him.</p>
